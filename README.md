# Basic-Repo
This is where I will store my code.

I'm Dan. This is not my first repository but it IS the first time I actually understand what I'm doing.
Last time I tried to make a repo, I followed a Git tutorial and failed miserably (it was late).
Hopefully I'll be able to code more effectively once I start using GitHub more.
I'm really interested in coding a bot from scratch to open, login, and play runescape for me.
Also! I want to start using a raspberry pi that I bought last year and have only used for really basic stuff
